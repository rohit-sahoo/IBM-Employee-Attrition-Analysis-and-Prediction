# IBM-Employee-Attrition-Analysis-and-Prediction
Employee attrition is described as the natural process through which employees leave the employment and are not quickly replaced, such as by resignation for personal reasons or retirement. Employee turnover is recognised as a critical issue for all businesses these days, owing to its negative impact on workplace productivity and meeting corporate goals on time. To maintain a competitive edge over its competitors, a business should make it a priority to reduce staff turnover. As a result, for the better growth of a corporation, it is critical for company leaders to understand the primary reasons why their employees choose to quit the firm, and then take appropriate actions to enhance their organization's efficiency, general workflow, and business performance.
